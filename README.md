Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze customer hotel reviews and classify them into sentiment categories such as Positive, Neutral, or Negative, based on the content of the text.

📊 Project Description
Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for improving hospitality services. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to interpret the sentiment behind user-submitted hotel reviews.

The dataset contains real-world hotel review texts, which were preprocessed and vectorized using TF-IDF. A Logistic Regression model was trained to predict the sentiment class of each review.
